# PSOC&trade; Edge MCU: CDC echo application using emUSB-host

This code example shows how to set up the USB block in the PSOC&trade; Edge MCU as a Communication Device Class (CDC) host using the emUSB-host middleware. It implements echo functionality from the host side and requires a USB device configured to echo the CDC signals back to the host.

This code example has a three project structure: CM33 secure, CM33 non-secure, and CM55 projects. All three projects are programmed to the external QSPI flash and executed in Execute in Place (XIP) mode. Extended boot launches the CM33 secure project from a fixed location in the external flash, which then configures the protection settings and launches the CM33 non-secure application. Additionally, CM33 non-secure application enables CM55 CPU and launches the CM55 application.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this code example.


## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox&trade;](https://www.infineon.com/modustoolbox) v3.6 or later (tested with v3.6)
- Board support package (BSP) minimum required version: 1.0.0
- Programming language: C
- Associated parts: All [PSOC&trade; Edge MCU](https://www.infineon.com/products/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex/32-bit-psoc-edge-arm) parts


## Supported toolchains (make variable 'TOOLCHAIN')

- GNU Arm&reg; Embedded Compiler v14.2.1 (`GCC_ARM`) – Default value of `TOOLCHAIN`
- Arm&reg; Compiler v6.22 (`ARM`)
- IAR C/C++ Compiler v9.50.2 (`IAR`)
- LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm&reg; v19.1.5 (`LLVM_ARM`)


## Supported kits (make variable 'TARGET')

- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC2`) – Default value of `TARGET`
- [PSOC&trade; Edge E84 Evaluation Kit](https://www.infineon.com/KIT_PSE84_EVAL) (`KIT_PSE84_EVAL_EPC4`)


## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Ensure the following jumper and pin configuration on board.
- BOOT SW must be in the HIGH/ON position
- J20 and J21 must be in the tristate/not connected (NC) position


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Operation

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PSOC Edge MCU: CDC echo application using emUSB-Host" is displayed on the UART terminal

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

4. The user LED blinks slowly to indicate a wait state. The USB host waits to connect with a USB device

5. Use a USB cable to connect the USB CDC echo device to the kit's USB host port, as shown in **Figure 2**

   **Figure 2. USB-host port**

   ![](images/kit-usb-host-port.png)

   See the [USB CDC device echo code example](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc-edge-usb-device-cdc-echo) for configuring an Infineon MCU with USB CDC echo functionality

6. When connected, the host acknowledges the addition of a USB CDC device, enumerates it and starts the echo using the Communication Device Class (CDC). The USB host sends a data packet at every 5 seconds containing the device details like VendorId and ProductId, as well as the data stream that is sent and received

   **Figure 3. USB device connected**

   ![](images/usbh_device_connected.png)

7. The USB device echoes the data stream back to the host to demonstrate the CDC echo functionality. The packets are continuously sent and received until the physical connection via the cable is disconnected

   **Figure 4. USB device disconnected**

   ![](images/usbh_device_disconnected.png)

8. For disconnection, if the USB device needs external power, first remove the KitProg connection powering the USB device kit and then disconnect the device kit from the host kit. The USB host stops the communication, acknowledges the removal of the USB device as shown in **Figure 4** and returns to the wait state until another USB device is connected to start the echo communication
